## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation (for local development)

1.  **Clone the repository (if you have one):**
    ```bash
    git clone [your_repository_url]
    cd [your_repository_name]
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You might need to create a `requirements.txt` file with the following dependencies if it doesn't exist)*
    ```
    python-dotenv
    streamlit
    langchain-community
    langchain-text-splitters
    langchain
    huggingface-hub
    groq
    ```

3.  **Obtain a Groq API Key:**
    * Sign up for a Groq account at [https://console.groq.com/](https://console.groq.com/).
    * Generate an API key from your account settings.

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
    * Add your Groq API key to the `.env` file:
        ```
        GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
        ```
        *(Replace `"YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"` with your actual API key)*

5.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run your_script_name.py
    ```
    *(Replace `your_script_name.py` with the name of your Python script, e.g., `app.py`)*

6.  **Open your browser:** The application should automatically open in your web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).
